# How to manage your Project Code

It's a great idea to save a copy of your work locally or in a version control system like GitHub. As an AI assistant, I can't directly control the Firebase Studio interface to perform these actions for you, but this guide should help you find the right options.

## How to Download Your Project Code

In most web-based development environments like Firebase Studio, you can usually find the option to download or export your project in one of these common places:

1.  **Main Toolbar or Menu Bar:** Look at the very top of the screen for a main menu (it might be labeled "File", "Project", or have a gear icon ⚙️). Inside that menu, you should find an option like "Export project...", "Download .zip", or "Download code".

2.  **File Explorer Panel:** Look at the top of the file explorer panel (where your list of files is). There might be a `...` (more options) button or an icon that looks like a cloud with a downward arrow (☁️ ⬇️). Clicking this may reveal a download option.

### After You Download

Once you have downloaded the project (it will likely be a `.zip` file), you will need to:

1.  **Unzip** the file on your local machine.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into the unzipped project folder.
3.  Run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.
4.  Run the command `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

## How to Push to a GitHub Repository

Connecting your project to GitHub is the standard way to manage your codebase.

### Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub

First, go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a **new, empty repository**. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license file, as your project already has these. After creating it, copy the repository's URL (it should end with `.git`).

### Step 2: Use the Source Control Panel in Firebase Studio

1.  **Find the Source Control Panel:** Look for a "Source Control" or "Git" icon in the activity bar (it often looks like a branching path). Click on it.
2.  **Initialize Repository:** If your project isn't already a Git repository, you'll likely see a button to "Initialize Repository" or "Publish to GitHub". Click it.
3.  **Stage Changes:** You should see a list of all the files in your project. Stage all the changes by clicking the `+` icon next to each file or a master `+` icon at the top of the list.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Once all files are staged, you'll need to "commit" them. Type a descriptive message (e.g., "Initial commit") into the message box and click the checkmark button ✔️ to commit.
5.  **Add Remote:** Your local Git repository now needs to know where your GitHub repository is. Look for an option to "Add Remote" or "Push to...". It will likely be in a `...` menu within the Source Control panel. Paste the GitHub repository URL you copied earlier.
6.  **Push Changes:** After adding the remote, find the "Push" command (it might be an icon with an up arrow ⬆️ or an option in the `...` menu). This will upload all your committed files to your GitHub repository.

I hope this helps you get your code safely into GitHub! Let me know if you want to work on any more code changes.
