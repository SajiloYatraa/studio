# How to Download Your Project Code

It's a great idea to save a copy of your work locally. As an AI assistant, I can't directly control the Firebase Studio interface to start a download for you, but this guide should help you find the option.

## Where to Look for the Download/Export Feature

In most web-based development environments like Firebase Studio, you can usually find the option to download or export your project in one of these common places:

1.  **Main Toolbar or Menu Bar:** Look at the very top of the screen for a main menu (it might be labeled "File", "Project", or have a gear icon ⚙️). Inside that menu, you should find an option like "Export project...", "Download .zip", or "Download code".

2.  **File Explorer Panel:** Look at the top of the file explorer panel (where your list of files is). There might be a `...` (more options) button or an icon that looks like a cloud with a downward arrow (☁️ ⬇️). Clicking this may reveal a download option.

3.  **Source Control Integration:** Check for a "Source Control" or "Git" icon (it often looks like a branching path). Firebase Studio might encourage you to connect your project to a GitHub repository, from which you can easily clone the code to your computer. This is a best practice for managing your code.

## After You Download

Once you have downloaded the project (it will likely be a `.zip` file), you will need to:

1.  **Unzip** the file on your local machine.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into the unzipped project folder.
3.  Run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.
4.  Run the command `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

I hope this helps you find the download feature! Let me know if you want to work on any more code changes.
