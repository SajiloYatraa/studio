## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of luxury and sophistication, referencing the rich scents of perfume.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5), a desaturated version of the primary color, provides a clean, neutral backdrop to showcase the content.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#C5CAE9), analogous to indigo, offers a delicate contrast and highlights interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif typeface for headlines. It reflects a geometric, high contrast style that adds elegance, well-suited to shorter content and larger headers.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif typeface. The pairing works nicely to complement and offset the modern sans-serif styling for a high-end contemporary feel that invites exploration.
- Use simple, elegant icons that represent different perfume categories and actions (e.g., user profiles, review submissions). SVG icons are preferred for scalability.
- Subtle animations on button hovers and transitions between pages to enhance user engagement.
